# Day-67 of `100-Days-Of-Code` Challenge

**Day-67 Task:**

Learn about TypeScript arrays by using the following guide and coding along with the examples provided in it:


## Type Annotations With Arrays

Type annotations with arrays allow you to specify the expected data types of the array elements, ensuring type safety in your code.

```tsx
// Annotating an array of strings
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

// Using a loop to process each element in the array
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Fruit: ${fruits[i].toUpperCase()}`);
}
```

1. We annotate the `fruits` array as an array of strings.
2. We use a `for` loop to iterate over the `fruits` array and display each fruit in uppercase letters.

## Type Annotations With Multidimensional Arrays

```tsx
let arrayOne: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayTwo: string[] = ["A", "B", "C"];
let arrayThree: (string | number)[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, "A", "B", "C"];

```

In this code:

1. `arrayOne` is declared as an array of numbers, annotated with the type `number[]`. This means it can only contain numeric values.
2. `arrayTwo` is declared as an array of strings, annotated with the type `string[]`. It should only contain string values.
3. `arrayThree` is declared as an array that can hold elements of either type string or number, annotated with `(string | number | boolean)[]`. This array allows for a mixture of numeric and string values within the same array.
